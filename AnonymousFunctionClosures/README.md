Anonymous Function and closures

-	What anonymous functions are, and how you create them
-	How to assign anonymous functions to variables
-	How to call anonymous functions
-	Using anonymous functions to create neater callbacks, and
-	Creating closures with anonymous functions.

There is a semicolon after the function definition. This is because anonymous function definitions are expressions, whereas regular function definitions are code constructs.

Assign it to a variable, then call it later using the variable's name. You can even store a bunch of different anonymous function in a single array.
Pass it to another function that can then call it later. This is known as a callback.
Return it from within an outer function so that it can access the outer function's variables. This is known as a closure.
