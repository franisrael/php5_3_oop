__callStatic() new magic method is added in PHP V5.3

PHP V5 has several specially defined methods that can be used inside classes
known as magic methods. When defined in the class, these methods provide special
functionallity, and enable:

-	Overloading (the ability to allow a method to accept different type of parameters)
-	Polymorphism (the ability to allow different data types to use the same interface)

They also open the door to using different types of OOP programming methods and design 
patterns with PHP easily. 


-	The __callStatic() magic method

-	Dynamic static calls
